## Gettings started

With our logs system you can easily set up logs throughout your entire server which you can later inspect in the dashboard.

This feature requires the **Basic** plan from Fivemanage.

## Usage

### LogMessage (server-side)

The `LogMessage` export takes in three arguments. `level`, `message` and `metadata`.

`level` - Values are either `info`, `warn` or `error`

`message` - any string

`metadata` - Can be a table or object with any properties you want. 
If you provide the `playerSource` as seen below, identifiers for the player will also be sent.


<Tabs items={['Lua', 'JavaScript']}>
    <Tab>
        ```lua
        exports.fivemanage_lib:LogMessage('info', "Someone did a bad thing", {
            playerSource = 1 
        })
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```ts
        exports.fivemanage_lib.LogMessage('error', "Player robbed the bank", {
            playerSource = 1
            bankName = "Main bank"
            moneyTaken = 9999999
        })
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>
